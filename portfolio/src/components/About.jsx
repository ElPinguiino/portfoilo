        <p>It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm a passionate Software Engineer with a background in IT Support and Administration. I have experience building web applications using various frameworks, libraries, and languages. As well as building and integrating IVR software solutions (CCaaS) for enterprise customers with third party APIs and services. I currently enjoy working with React on the frontend and Django for the backend, but I'm always open to using the most appropriate tools for the job. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I believe that creating user-friendly and efficient solutions is key to the success of any software application. I'm a collaborative team player who values effective communication and mutual respect. I am currently finishing up my Bachelor's degree in Cloud and Systems Administration at the Western Governor's University and will be finished December 2023. I'm looking forward to working with you!
